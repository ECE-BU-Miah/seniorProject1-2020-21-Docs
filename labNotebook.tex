%
% HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE 
% Each day in the lab consists of three main things:
%
% 1. LABDAY: The first thing to put is the \labday{} command with a date in 
% curly brackets, this will make a new section showing that you are working
% on a new day.
%
% 2. EXPERIMENT/SUBEXPERIMENT: Next you need to specify what 
% experiment(s) and subexperiment(s) you are working on with a 
% \experiment{} and \subexperiment{} commands with the experiment 
% shorthand in the curly brackets. The experiment shorthand is defined in the 
% 'DEFINITION OF EXPERIMENTS' section below, this means you can 
% say \experiment{pcr} and the actual text written to the PDF will be what 
% you set the 'pcr' experiment to be. If the experiment is a one off, you can 
% just write it in the bracket without creating a shorthand. Note: if you don't 
% want to have an experiment, just leave this out and it won't be printed.
%
% 3. CONTENT: Following the experiment is the content, i.e. what progress 
% you made on the experiment that day.

Today, in the meeting with Dr. Miah, we kicked off the project involving development of a building enery management platform. A Github repository was created for the project which will also be paired with a corresponding Google Drive titled "seniorProject1-2020-21". On Tuesdays and Thursdays, we will have lab time from 8am to 11am and weekly meetings with the advisor from 4pm to 5pm on Mondays this semester. The lab times are devoted specifically for work rather than research or documentation. Before coming to lab, work must be cut out for both of us.

\experiment{Homework}
BL\\
This document was created and pushed to the Github repository for both of us to use. For better portability, one of the laptops previously used for research on this project was wiped clean and LUbuntu was installed. As of now, most of the code developed for the platform was done on a desktop PC dual-booted with Ubuntu Linux and Windows 10. To be able to move between lab and home easily, a more ideal situation is to use a dedicated laptop with Linux installed. Because the USB drive used to install Linux was previously formatted with Ubuntu 18.04, the diskpart utility was used with the following commands:
\begin{Verbatim}
select disk 1
clean 
create partition primary
format quick
\end{Verbatim}
The Startup Disk Creator GUI program on Linux was utilized to flash the LUbuntu 64-bit desktop iso file on to the USB-thumb drive. The commands \texttt{sudo apt-get update} and \texttt{sudo apt-get upgrade} were run on the laptop to perform necessary upgrades and updates. Lastly, \texttt{sudo apt-get install git} was used to install git. Another package installed was \texttt{textlive-full} to compile latex with all the necessary packages.

\experiment{Meeting Minutes}
BL\\
In the meeting with Dr. Miah, Dr. Miah pointed out that templates are available in the Google Drive for the lab notebook and other deliverables which we did not realize. In the System Level Requirements document (the first deliverable) we must replace the current block diagram with the drawing of the house connected to a microgrid. Inside, the home will be a block of the BEMS core which will connect to various IoT devices in the building. The controllable loads in the building including devices like lights, appliances (including dishwashers, washing machines), and smart plugs. Examples of uncontrollable loads include desktop PCs, laptops, thermistors, and microwaves. In a potential future research project, connectivity with a microgrid may be possible, so powerlines representing the main grid will be connecting the house to a microgrid through a PCC (Point of Common Coupling). In the current version of the diagram, the file is simply too large as it contains many images from the Internet. This will be redrawn in inkscape with custom figures to reduce the file size.
\smallbreak\noindent
The final outcome of the project will be
\begin{itemize}
\item Laptop running in the IoT lab or office
\item 2-3 devices in office/lab can be controlled succesfully
\item System should recognize the devices immediately upon connection to the network
\item Algorithm implemented to help improve energy efficiency
\end{itemize}
As a part of the first deliverable, three modes of operation will be declared including
\begin{itemize}
\item Device search mode
\item Device operation mode
\item Third mode to be determined
\end{itemize}
The sections of the deliverable will be
\begin{itemize}
\item Problem Statement
\item System Architecture
\item Block Diagram
\item Modes of Operation
\end{itemize}
Another point brought up is whether an energy efficient algorithm should be included in the software. Dr. Miah said yes. This will possibly help to boost the complexity of the project and improve the usefuleness of the platform. This algorithm will have to be determined.
\smallbreak\noindent
As of today, we should both be writing code on Tuesdays and Thursdays or possibly on our own, and we can both use code written for the research project. The split should be 50/50 so a Gantt chart will need to be made.

Elliot and I met over Zoom to work on getting a new Github repo setup for the senior project code specifically. Although Dr. Miah mentioned in the meeting that the code should be on Github, we simply will periodically upload the zipped Github project to the Drive to the implementation/ folder. I copied over the files from the research to the new Github repo cloned locally on my Linux laptop. After running the \texttt{install.sh} script, the installation failed as the Linux laptop I am using is running Python3.5 rather than Python3.6 which is required for f-string support. An example of a line that failed is shown in the figure below:
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figs/img/installSyntaxError}
\caption{f string error in \texttt{utils.py}}
\end{figure}
A simple solution to this problem was simply using string concatenation:
\begin{Verbatim}
strTStamp = str(tstamp.month) + "/" + str(tstamp.day) + "/" + str(tstamp.year) + " "
strTStamp += str(tstamp.hour) + ":" + str(tstamp.minute) + ":" + str(tstamp.second)
\end{Verbatim}
Further changes were made in the \texttt{ControlAgent.py} and \texttt{DiscoveryAgent.py} files. In particular, the line in \texttt{subscribe} to connect to the server acting as the central exchange to process publish/subscribe messages between the web server backend and agents listening for subscriptions was altered to support string concatenation. After these alterations to the source code were made, the platform was succesfully started. However, it is clear that no messages published to the server were received by both either the \texttt{ControlAgent} or \texttt{DiscoveryAgent} which will need to be debugged in the next lab or possilby before. This is evident as the terminals showing the debug output of each agent not indicating any messages received. Messages should be published via the publish function in the file \texttt{PROJECT\_DIR/WebServer/pubsub.py}. All these problems must be fixed to allow the ActiveDevices page to discover and connect to devices.
\end{addmargin}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------c--------------------

\labday{Thursday, September 24, 2020}
BL\\
Today, I debugged some of the problems with the \texttt{ControlAgent} agent not receiving messages. The agent was run in isolation and tested with the publish function in the \texttt{pubsub.py} file. The agent was able to successfully receive messages. However, this was not tested while the platform was running which will need to be done in the next lab session.

I (Elliot) started to create a device driver for the BeagleBone Blue based off of the WeMo Switch driver. In doing so, I also started researching ways to control individual pins via wifi, starting with the GPIO.

\labday{Monday, September 28, 2020}

\experiment{Meeting Minutes}
EW\\

\textbf{Agenda:}

How to auto-detect devices on the network (interrupt or polling)? We were thinking of constantly pinging the network for supported devices in an infinite loop. Is there a way for a device to send a request to the server once it has joined the network?

We would like to add support for a smart power meter that can connect to WiFi,
so power data for the entire building/house can be shown in the UI. What would
you recommend in terms of a cost-effective solution? I found a device called the
Sense Energy Monitor that can send data over wifi to an mobile or web app that
comes with the device. The device itself connects to the electrical panel of a
house. However, it is quite expensive at a price of 299 dollars.

Does the platform still need to be agent-based like BEMOSS? 

\textbf{Discussion:} For auto-detecting, we need to research how to create an
interrupt. IF that turns out to be impossible, we will try to replicate Windows
trying to find bluetooth devices. It will be a poling process that is explicitly
demanded by the user.

MATLAB can be used to measure power usage. Simscape is an addon that includes a
power sensor module. After checking online, we also discovered it is possible to
connect MATLAB to a website and transfer data. With this, we should be able to
plot power usage on the UI.

FInally, Dr. Miah informed us that the project will indeed be agent-based.

\experiment{Lab work}
BL\\
Today, work was done on getting the linux laptop connected to the "AERO" network in the senior project lab, so that experiments can be done properly with the WeMo Switch and eventually Beaglebone Blue. Because this was not working, Elliot set up a hotspot on his laptop which was tethered through BUSecure. Secondly, Elliot paired the WeMo Switch with the WiFi network in the lab with his phone as I did not remember the password to my WeMo account, so a new one was made. A couple of bugs were still present in the current version of the software. One of them was causing the \texttt{ControlAgent} to crash everytime a publish message was attempted to be sent through interprocess communication. We found the problem was due to the following error
\begin{Verbatim}
can't convert type 'dict' to 'str' implicitly
\end{Verbatim} 
This was fixed by using \texttt{json.dumps} in the \texttt{pubsub.publish} function. At the end of the lab session, we were able to succesfully toggle the WeMo Switch on and off through our platform. One of the things Elliot pointed out was the fact that the checkbox toggle button for turning the device on and off is not set to the proper position when the page is loaded as it is always in the off position. We decided this feature will need to be added soon as it had not been added.

\labday{Thursday, October 1, 2020}

\experiment{Lab work}
BL\\
We decided to write down the trace of commands/function calls that occur from the top layer (UI layer) all the way down to the bottom layer (device API layer) to turn on/off the Switch:
\begin{itemize}
\item Main active devices page: \texttt{PROJECT\_DIR/WebServer/templates/active\_devices.html}
\item JS code running on \texttt{active\_device.js} calls \texttt{\$.ajax()} which sends an AJAX request to the url '/active\_devices/ajax/setDeviceStatus'
\item Sending a POST request to URL '/active\_devices/ajax/setDeviceStatus' calls sendDeviceStatusToControlAgent()
\item In subscribe of \texttt{PROJECT\_DIR/AgentPlatform/ControlAgent.py} a call to processMethod() occurs which calls setDeviceStatus()
\item setDeviceStatus() calls \texttt{WeMoAPI.setState}
\item \texttt{PROJECT\_DIR/DeviceDrivers/WeMoAPI.py} setState() function sends an XML SOAP request over HTTP to the WeMo Switch
\end{itemize}
In order to display the correct device status on the web server via the \texttt{getDeviceStatus()} method in the \texttt{ControlAgent} class:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{getState} will retrieve the status using XML SOAP requests
\item \texttt{renderActiveDevices()} will be called in \texttt{active\_devices.py}. We would like to eventually poll for a state change (Not necessarily this function). Also, we want to use the most recent timeseries data from a table.
\item First we will need to use \texttt{getState()}, but eventually we want to use a data table. Also, we need to research interrupts. 
\end{itemize}
I suggested installing the Cassandra database in the software as a first step towards getting the status updated on the web page as it can store time series data easily. The instructions for install Cassandra are listed below taken from \footnote{\url{https://cassandra.apache.org/download/}}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{echo "deb https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/debian 311x main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cassandra}
\item \texttt{curl https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/KEYS | sudo apt-key add -}
\item \texttt{sudo apt-get update}
\end{enumerate}
We encountered the following error which was documented on the site
\begin{verbatim}
GPG error: http://www.apache.org 311x InRelease: 
The following signatures couldn't be verified 
because the public key is not available: NO\_PUBKEY: E91...
\end{verbatim}
The PUBKEY is extracted from the error message itself and must be added with 
\texttt{sudo apt-key adv --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-key E91..}
\medbreak\noindent
Lastly the software was installed with \texttt{sudo apt-get install cassandra}. To interface with the software with Python, we decided to use the DataStax Python driver for Apache Cassandra. It was installed with the following commands
\begin{enumerate}
\item source venv/bin/activate
\item pip3 install cassandra-driver
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Agenda:}
\begin{itemize}
\item What is a reliable and efficient way to obtain the status of the WeMo and update the checkbox on the web page? This is needed in case someone turns the WeMo on and off manually.
\item Is a Gantt chart required for the first deliverable?
\item Could you review what we have written so far for the first deliverable?
\item We are considering integrating the DC motor with the software through the BeagleBone Blue. As an extension from the project in 2019 would we be able to add a speed control algorithm to use PWM to control motor speed? If so, should we develop our own or use the one from your mechatronics textbook?

\textbf{Minutes:}
\begin{itemize}
\item We should use an Interrupt Service Routine to get device status from Wemo Switch. This will be used to update the status being displayed on the web server. 
\item We will not be using a Gantt chart.
\item If we want to implement the DC motor, we have to come up with a useful application. The shaft must be connected to a load. We are thinking of driving a fan which could realistically be used to control a fan possibly a CPU heatsink fan. It does not matter if we use Dr. Miah's control algorithm or our own.
\item Our current issue is: the Wemo switch fails to turn on/off from the application if someone turns it on/off manually. For

Today, Elliot and I worked on ways of possibly implementing an interrupt whenever the WeMo Switch is turned on or off. Various blogs on interrupts in Python3 were found regarding KeyboardInterrupts and GPIO with the Raspberry Pi. It may not be possible to cause the Switch to generate an interrupt signal on its own as this may not be built into the firmware of the device. Initially some problems were encountered as a problem was encountered in the file \texttt{PROJECT\_DIR/WebServer/static/js/apps/active\_device.js} as the Javascript object named \texttt{evt} was not passed as a parameter to the callback function for the input checkbox event listener. This was then used to call
\begin{Verbatim}
evt.preventDefault();
\end{Verbatim}
which according to the Jquery documentation cancels the default navigation of the click. This is not necessarily needed as it runs properly without the method call. Work was done on implementing the feature to update the checkbox position whenever the DOM is ready. One of the problems that needs to be solved is obtaining the data from the web server after sending a AJAX GET request. This will be done by receiving a JSON object in the response to the AJAX request. According the jQuery documentation\footnote{\url{https://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/}}, one of the optional arguments to be passed is the \texttt{success} parameter which can hold the arguments
\begin{itemize}
\item data
\item status
\item settings
\end{itemize}

One of the problems we faced into today's lab session was the Switch's port number incrementing by 1. Yesterday, the port number was 49154 and today it is 49155. We'll have to determine why this is happening.
We are also trying to improve the getDeviceStatus() function to get both the id of the WeMo and the powerstate. A solution to this problem is using a list nested in a dictionary along with a key value pair for the id of the device. One of the feaures of javascript that we do not know to implement is how to set the checkbox position with javascript.

Brian and I tried to get the refresh button on the "active devices" page to reload the check box for the WeMo switch. This task is proving to be more challenging than we thought. Neither of us has much experience with JavaScript. We need to learn how to access each button and their properties in active\_device.js if we want this feature to work.

Today, the Aero router was missing from the lab. We instead used my Windows laptop as a hotspot to connect to the Wemo. Once we got connected, we continued with the task of updating the check box on the active devices page with the current Wemo status. At the beginning of this session, refreshing the check box would turn the Wemo on or off instead of just changing the check box. By 9:22 AM, we were able to refresh the status of the check box on the active devices page with the actual state of the Wemo switch. I took a short video of our progress with the Wemo Switch; that needs to be uploaded to the Deliverables folder of the Docs repo.
Next, we decided to start implementing the Apache Cassandra database. This will lead us into the next feature for the Wemo: recording power usage. 
Our plan:
\begin{itemize}
\item Set up the database
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The Cassandra database needs to be set up outside of python, then it can be accessed
	\item We believe we can automate the set up process with a shell script that can be run from python
	\end{itemize}
\item Implement a function to write data to it 
\item Implement a function to read data back from the database
\item Implement a function to display data on the active devices page
\item Figure out a way to plot a graph of power usage with matplotlib in python

\item We should list all the features found in BEMOSS or another BEMS platforms and explain how ours is different. We need to gather some standard features that people have used in similar projects. Find at least 5 other platforms. Use library resources and contact Dr. Miah if we can't get access to a source.
\item I (Elliot) will start implementing support for the beaglebone blue and Brian will work on implementing additional features (right now that is the Apache Cassandra Database and power recording).
\end{itemize}

Today, I started looking into running python files on the BeagleBone Blue. I installed the Adafruit library: https://pypi.org/project/Adafruit-BBIO/ and was able to run a simple program to flash the on-board LEDs. However, Dr. Miah mentioned that I should look into the rcpy library as an alternative. After settling on a control library, I need to figure out how to connect to the BeagleBone Blue from the platform.
Dr. Miah also reminded us both to start looking into standard features found in other energy management systems similar to BEMS.

I worked on adding calls to the various cassandra library methods and class constructors to interact with the Cassandra database. In the Discovery agent, I added a query to create a new table for each device when it is discovered by the discovery agent in the \texttt{setDeviceToActive} method. Each table will have fields
\begin{itemize}
\item id text
\item power double
\item status text
\item tstamp timestamp
\end{itemize}
for now. However, this will likely need to be changed when new devices are added. Secondly, another query execution call was added to the method \texttt{periodicQueryBehavior} in the \texttt{ControlAgent} which will add a new entry to a given device table every 10 seconds inside a separate thread from the main program. In order to initialize the database, a keyspace was created titled "bemstimeseries" which will need to be added to the database when the platform is installed. This likely be added to the \texttt{install.sh} script. The last task I worked on was installing matplotlib which gave me trouble as python3.5 is installed on the LUbuntu laptop running the server. However, this python package requires Python3.6 and later. I will need to work on figuring out how to update python on the laptop if possible.

I decided to try just installing matplotlib and all the necessary dependencies like numpy with older versions supported by python3.5. The following dependencies and their corresponding versions are required for python3.5
\begin{itemize}
\item matplotlib==1.5.1
\item numpy==1.11.0
\item dateutil==2.4.2
\item pytz==2014.10
\end{itemize}
Another problem was encountered when attempting to install the dateutil python3 package as a messaged was displayed that python3.5 reached the end of its life on September 13, 2020. A solution to this problem I will try to implement is installing the latest version of Lubuntu 20.04 LTS. Dr. Miah approved this.

The next task is to determine where to create a new keyspace in the cassandra table. I added this in the \texttt{run.sh} file for now but may make more sense to place in the \texttt{install.sh} file. Next I worked on inspecting the keyspace for new tables when a new device is discovered. Unfortunately, no new tables were showing up after the \texttt{DiscoveryAgent} did its work in the \texttt{setDeviceToActive} method. The CQL query:
\begin{Verbatim}
SELECT * FROM system_schema.tables WHERE keyspace_name = 'bemstimeseries';
\end{Verbatim}
should list all the table information in the 'bemstimeseries' keyspace. The next logical step is to run the query in the \texttt{setDeviceToActive} method which will create a table for the device. In the \texttt{cqlsh} command line program, I ran into the exception
\begin{Verbatim}
InvalidRequest: Error from server: code=2200 [Invalid query] 
message="No PRIMARY KEY specifed (exactly one required)"
\end{Verbatim}
This error makes sense as no primary key was supplied in the CREATE TABLE command. A second error was encountered after adding in a primary key:
\begin{Verbatim}
SyntaxException: line 1:59 no viable alternative at input 
'PRIMARY_KEY' (... EXISTS bemstimeseries.device1 (id [UUID] PRIMARY_KEY...)
\end{Verbatim}
After executing the query 
\begin{Verbatim}
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS bemstimeseries.wemo 
(id UUID PRIMARY_KEY, power double, status text, tstamp timestamp);
\end{Verbatim}
\end{document}
